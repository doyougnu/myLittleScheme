## Thoughts at the end
if you somehow found your way here with an interest in the book I would 
recommend against it. The book is seriously outdated, the exercises stop after
chapter 5 and so does any explanation. I really felt like the book should be
about twice as long as it is. It simply just isn't enough even for an 
intermediate Haskeller such as me.
